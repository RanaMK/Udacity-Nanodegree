## Project Motivation

This project (Writing a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

I used the Stackoverflow Developer Annual Survey for the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

The original Dataset can be found here:https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
I used the Survey csv for each year.

In this project, I focus on the development field and software engineering as a lot of people and students would like to know what are the current and future status of programming.
The first question that comes to mind when talking about programming and development is what are the top used programming languages and are those languages going to disappear in the future or not so we are going to check the top programming languages as well as database languages used by actual developers and what are their thoughts about languages in the future. 

The code and blog post is divided into 3 main questions answered through the data.
Question 1: What are the top programming languages used in the last four years wordwide?
Question 2: How does working with databases change over time?
Question 3: How developers are thinking about programming and database languages in the future?


## Libraries

I am using Python3 with no special libraries.
The libraries I used: Numpy, Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn.
